## Taxation

Senator BIRMINGHAM (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (14:00):  My question is to the minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Minister, rather than using the weasel words we've become so accustomed to from Labor ministers of, 'We have no plans,' which the Australian public now know will precipitate yet another Labor broken promise, can you, and will the Prime Minister, categorically rule out any change or changes that limit the use of negative gearing or franking credits by Australians? 

Senator WONG (South Australia—Minister for Foreign Affairs and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:00):  It says something that the opposition is so interested in talking about what the government is not doing, because, of course, they can't talk about what the government is doing because that particular negative campaign has fallen flat, hasn't it, President? The reality is: those opposite are desperate to find another front because, after a lot of huffing and puffing, they're now backing Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's tax plan. That is what they are doing, so they're desperate now to talk about what we are not doing instead of what we are doing. We have made our position on those which—

Senator Birmingham:  Australians are scared about what you might do!

Senator WONG:  Which promise might you break?

Opposition senators interjecting—

The PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Wong, please resume your seat. Order on my left! Senator Cash. Minister, please continue.

Senator WONG:  We are reforming the income tax system and providing income tax relief to Australians who are doing it tough. That's what we are doing; that is our focus. We are not looking at other changes in the tax system; we are looking at the changes in the income tax system. The reason we are doing that is Labor MPs, Labor senators and ministers, have understood how important it is for us to respond to cost-of-living pressures.

Opposition senators interjecting—

Senator WONG:  I know you don't want to talk about cost-of-living pressures—

The PRESIDENT:  Order! I have Senator Birmingham on his feet. 

Senator Birmingham:  A matter of direct relevance: the question did not mention income tax. The question invited the minister, very clearly, to address community concerns on negative gearing and franking credits. The minister has not come near either of those two specific topics raised in the question. I ask you to draw her to the question.

The PRESIDENT:  Minister Wong, I will withdraw you—I'll draw you to Senator Birmingham's question.

Senator Birmingham:  Can you do that too? Withdrawing the call is an option!

Senator WONG:  Well, I hope not! That'd be interesting; I would have to accept it. We are not proposing any other changes in the areas that the senator has outlined. I again say to anybody listening: understand what is happening here. Those opposite have backed Anthony Albanese's tax plan. That's what they've done, and now they're trying to distract from it with another scare campaign. (Time expired)

The PRESIDENT:  Senator Birmingham, a first supplementary? 

Senator BIRMINGHAM (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (14:03):  I note the continuation of the words Australians now know mean a backflip like 'not proposing any other changes at this stage' continue. Ministers, including the Prime Minister, have previously refused to explicitly rule out changing the taxation treatment of the family home. Will the minister and the Prime Minister categorically rule out applying capital gains tax or any other tax to the family home, or do the weasel words apply there too?

Senator WONG (South Australia—Minister for Foreign Affairs and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:04):  Here we go again: another day, another of Dutton's attempted scare campaigns. No, we are not proposing those tax changes either. The reality is everybody knows that the—

Senator McKenzie interjecting—

Senator WONG:  Do you know what is embarrassing? You're backing Albo. That's what's embarrassing for you. That's what you can't bear, Senator McKenzie, isn't it? After all that huffing and puffing, you've realised, 'Actually, Anthony Albanese got it right.' That's what you've realised. Now you've come in here and you've gone: 'Oh my goodness. We'd better come up with another scare campaign so that hopefully people won't notice that we're backing the Prime Minister.' You're backing a Labor prime minister's plan because you know he did it right. You know he got it right. So now you've got to try and find something else to fight about.

Senator Cash interjecting—

The PRESIDENT:  When you've finished, Senator Cash, Senator Birmingham's on his feet.

Senator Birmingham:  Again, on direct relevance, could Minister Wong at least utter the words 'family home' in her answer?

Honourable senators interjecting—

The PRESIDENT:  Order! The minister was being relevant. Minister, did you wish to finish?

Senator WONG:  We are not proposing any changes of the type you were describing. But I want to say again, everybody, I am so pleased that the opposition has finally understood that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has got it right.

The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Wong.

Honourable senators interjecting—

The PRESIDENT:  Order! I've had to call the chamber to order a number of times, particularly on my left. I've named senators, I've called you to order and you've ignored me. I expect you to respect my calls. Senator Birmingham, a second supplementary?

Senator BIRMINGHAM (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (14:06):  After the Prime Minister broke his promise made on more than a hundred occasions to not change the stage 3 tax cuts and broke his promise to not change superannuation tax arrangements, how can Australians believe a word of this minister or the Prime Minister when all they come out with are the weasel words 'we have no plans' or 'we are not proposing any changes at this time', when every time they've said that they go and break the promise afterwards?

Senator Carol Brown:  No cuts to the ABC, no cuts to the SBS!

The PRESIDENT:  I'm waiting to call Senator Wong. Senator Brown!

Senator Carol Brown:  All coming back to you.

The PRESIDENT:  Senator Brown! I should not have had to call you twice. Minister Wong.

Senator WONG (South Australia—Minister for Foreign Affairs and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:06):  If the opposition really believed that the Prime Minister's decision was so wrong, then they would vote against these tax cuts. They would vote against them and they would go to the next election with their deputy leader's policy of rolling back these changes—because, as soon as they vote for this, what we know is that they are agreeing that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese did the right thing by Australian workers.
